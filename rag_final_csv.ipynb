    "\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "INSTRUCTIONS\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "1. Generate SQL queries **only** for structured or numeric filters.\n",
    "   Examples:\n",
    "   - Total sales, sum, count, average, quantity, or price-based questions  \n",
    "   - Filtering by columns such as Status, Category, Material, or Color  \n",
    "   - Date-based filters (e.g., orders after 2025-05-01)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Do NOT** generate queries based on subjective or descriptive logic\n",
    "   such as reasons for cancellation, customer feedback, or preferences.\n",
    "   These are handled separately by a semantic retriever system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the correct table name `orders` and column names **exactly as shown**.\n",
    "   Preserve proper case and special characters (e.g., `\"Total Price (₹)\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Never hallucinate columns, tables, or calculations that do not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Return **only** the SQL query — no markdown, comments, or explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **SAFETY RULES — STRICTLY ENFORCED**\n",
    "   - Never modify or delete data.\n",
    "   - Do not use or suggest `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, or `ALTER`.\n",
    "   - Do not create or alter schemas, indexes, or tables.\n",
    "   - Only allow read-only operations:  \n",
    "     `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Case Handling:**  \n",
    "   When matching text values (like product or status), use `LOWER()` to make comparisons case-insensitive.  \n",
    "   Example:  \n",
    "   `WHERE LOWER(\"Product Name\") = LOWER('Toilet Bowl')`\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Special Handling — Highest or Maximum Queries:**  \n",
    "   If the user asks questions like  \n",
    "   *\"Who made the highest purchase?\"*,  \n",
    "   *\"Which client has the largest total?\"*, or  \n",
    "   *\"Top buyer / maximum purchase amount\"*,  \n",
    "   use this pattern to avoid grouping errors:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT \"Client Name\", \"Total Price (₹)\"\n",
    "   FROM orders\n",
    "   WHERE \"Total Price (₹)\" = (\n",
    "       SELECT MAX(\"Total Price (₹)\") FROM orders\n",

    "\n",
    "         Examples:\n",
    "        - \"How many orders are pending?\"\n",
    "        - \"List all clients whose orders are cancelled.\"\n",
    "        - \"Show orders where quantity > 10.\"\n",

    "        - \"Show total sales amount from Bangalore.\"\n",
    "        - \"Names of clients who placed multiple orders.\"\n",
    "        - \"List all clients whose orders are cancelled and who prefer décor items.\"\n",

    "        2. **semantic** → The question requires interpretation, reasoning, or subjective understanding\n",
    "        that cannot be directly derived from the dataset’s structured fields.\n",
    "        These questions involve opinions, trends, likelihood, aesthetics or suitability.\n",
